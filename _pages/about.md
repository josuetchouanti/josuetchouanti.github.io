I am a starting researcher (so called *Starting Research Position*) in the team [LIFEWARE](http://lifeware.inria.fr/) of the INRIA Center of Saclay where I work on individual-based modeling of coupled single-cell and cell population processes. 

Before that, I was a postdoc researcher in Unité de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées - ENS Lyon under the supervision of [Hélène Leman](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/helene.leman/), [Hélène Morlon](https://www.phyloeco.bio.ens.psl.eu/) and [Amaury Lambert](https://smile.cnrs.fr/people/amaury/) working on multi-scale approaches in adaptive dynamics.


Research interest
------
The core of my research activity is the construction and study of deterministic/stochastic models of complex phenomena from Biology and life sciences. More precisely, my work focuses on mathematical tools for applications in ecology, population genetics, (Meta)population dynamics, epidemiology and cell metabolism.
